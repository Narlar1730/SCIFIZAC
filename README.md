# SCIFIZAC
This is a quick game made to test out sfml and multithreading in c++
Run the game by running make, then ./on the binary.
It is not good yet, but it is interesting
The screen is handled differently to the input handling to the game logic - if the screen crashes, the game goes on, or more likely, the screen crashes and the game goes on. 

As it stands, arrow keys to shoot. WASD to move. l to change to shotgun which is broken and will be fixed soon. Mostly just adding this stuff so that the readme is longer.
